## Inspiration
Embarking on the healthcare track at NWHacks 2024, our team was fueled by a genuine passion for enhancing prescription usability. Many of us have faced the challenges of managing prescriptions, inspiring us to create a solution that keeps patients on track.

## What it does
Our web app takes your healthcare journey seriously. Seamlessly upload, view, and receive medical reminders â€“ fostering confidence and control in your health management. See our video demo! https://youtu.be/Z2Ze36Uzd4Q
